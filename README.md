# Mari Mems
Mari Mems is a 3 level memory game where players must match the cards. 
Each difficulty level is associated with colour. Beginner is uses the colour Red as it has been found to be the most attention grabbing and easiest to remember, ending with Green and earth tone often associated with camoflaugue intentionally making things harder see thus making recall more difficult.

## UX
This website is for people who currently enjoy any form of memory brain training and those interested in improving their level of recollection. 

### Wireframes
I created the wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

[Please see Wireframes here.](Insert wireframes link in google photos)
### Fonts 
The fonts chosen for the website are [name of font](font link) for headings and [name of font](font link) for body text. Why choose these fonts
### Colours
I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help me select a suitable colour scheme. I wanted colours that complimented each other but were also fairly warm and inviting.
